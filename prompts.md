Get better at Markdown syntax. Note the Markdown Quick Reference in RStudio. Good tutorial: <http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/>

Get a GitHub Personal Access Token. The help for `gh::gh_whoami()` documents the process. Then use it with a local Git repo, that has a little bit of history, in order to connect it up to GitHub via `usethis::use_github()`. Prove that the history survives (main difference with low-tech solutions based on "GitHub first").

Take an existing project of yours and make in RStudio Project, Git repo, GitHub repo.

Take an existing project of yours and add `.R` --> `.md` to a couple key files.

Take an existing project, turn on GitHub Pages, and create a few internal links to expose pieces others might want to consume.

Try to fix a small bug or make a small PR (on docs? add example?) to an R package developed on GitHub.

What's a topic you're interested in diving deeper into that's not here? We'll try to think up a prompt! Already got this request:

  * How do you actually go back to a previous state in the Git history? Temporarily or permanently.
